about tech and computer system

In the past few weeks, I have been attending the Exploring Digital Technology classes. In these classes, I have learned about many functional aspects of computers that were previously unknown to me. In the initial phase of the course, I learned how to convert decimal numbers to binary numbers and how binary numbers are used in various computer operations. Later, I learned how information is processed with the help of a computer's CPU.Today, most computers use 64-bit processing to handle the information needed for various tasks. The CPU processes the data and commands the memory to store the necessary information. This data moves through a wiring system consisting of a data bus and an address bus. These buses transfer data to memory, and then the contents of the memory move to the database. This is how computer operations take place.All of these concepts were unknown to me until we reached weeks two and three of the course.
