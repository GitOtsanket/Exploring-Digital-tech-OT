# Exploring-Digital-tech-OT
about tech and computer system

In the past few weeks, I have been attending the Exploring Digital Technology classes. In these classes, I have learned about many functional aspects of computers that were previously unknown to me. In the initial phase of the course, I learned how to convert decimal numbers to binary numbers and how binary numbers are used in various computer operations. Later, I learned how information is processed with the help of a computer's CPU.Today, most computers use 64-bit processing to handle the information needed for various tasks. The CPU processes the data and commands the memory to store the necessary information. This data moves through a wiring system consisting of a data bus and an address bus. These buses transfer data to memory, and then the contents of the memory move to the database. This is how computer operations take place.All of these concepts were unknown to me until we reached weeks two and three of the course.

This week in our tech class, we delved into the fascinating world of binary numbers and their crucial role in modern computing, especially in the context of quantum computing and the architecture of our current machines. Our discussions primarily centered around the fundamental "base-2" system. As we learned, at the heart of all software operations lie the binary digits, 0 and 1. These seemingly simple digits are the building blocks of all the data and instructions that our computers process. We often encounter these bits in groups. Anuradha ma'am provided us with a foundational understanding of how hardware utilizes the binary system to execute software.
Once the address is identified, the data bus comes into play. This bus is responsible for transferring the actual content – the data or the instructions represented in binary form – between the memory and the CPU. So, while the address bus points to where the information is, the data bus carries what the information is. Furthermore, we discussed the role of control signals and transistors within the hardware. Control gates within these transistors regulate the flow of electrical current. When a control signal is applied (again, represented by binary values), it can open or close these gates, allowing or blocking the passage of electrical signals that represent the binary data.




my journal in the month of february

Our group studied the various kinds of Read-Only Memory (ROM) in February 2025 as part of our course on Exploring Digital Technology. This subject was especially interesting because it integrated both theoretical understanding and real-world application. As our main source of information, Computer Organization by Hamacher, we concentrated on thoroughly comprehending PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM. The book offered a methodical explanation of these memory technologies in relation to computer memory systems in general.

We discovered that after manufacturing, PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory) can only be programmed once. Because PROM data is permanent once it is written, it can be used to store firmware that never needs to be changed. Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, or EPROM, gined popularity as its features are those for which we can use uv light to remove the data from the EPROM. Even though this method appeared to be good, we also came to know about its flaws, such as the lengthy erasure process. But, the greatest flexibility was offered by EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM). Even at the byte level, it is electrically rewriteable and erasable. Because of this, EEPROM is perfect for contemporary use cases like BIOS firmware, where updates are occasionally required without taking the chip out.
We came to the conclusion during our presentation and discussion that these memory types are significant milestones in the creation of contemporary non-volatile memory technologies, not merely historical details. Even though flash memory has mostly supplanted them in recent years, knowing their composition and behavior helped us better understand how hardware choices affect computer systems' functionality and performance.

We also gained a better understanding of the trade-offs engineers must make when designing memory, including those between cost, speed, flexibility, and permanence. Particularly useful in relating the technical details to actual computer design was the reading from Hamacher's chapter on memory. Overall, this experience was helpful in understanding ROM types as well as the basic role that memory architecture plays in computer operation
